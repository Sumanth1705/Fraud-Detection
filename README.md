# Fraud-Detection
# Overview of the Fraud Detection Project
## Objective
The primary objective of this project is to design and implement a database system to detect and manage fraudulent transactions in a financial institution. The system aims to identify potentially fraudulent activities and generate alerts for further investigation, ensuring enhanced security and compliance with regulatory requirements.

# Project Scope
User Management: Storing and managing user information.
Account Management: Recording details of user accounts.
Transaction Monitoring: Logging transactions and monitoring them for fraudulent activities.
Fraud Detection: Defining and applying rules to identify suspicious transactions.
Alert System: Generating and managing alerts for detected fraud.
Logging: Keeping detailed logs of transactions and alerts for auditing purposes.
Key Components and Schema
Users Table

## Purpose: Store information about account holders.
Fields:
user_id: Primary Key, Auto Increment
name: Not Null
email: Unique, Not Null
phone_number
address
date_of_birth
account_created: Default Current Timestamp
Accounts Table

## Purpose: Store information about user accounts.
Fields:
account_id: Primary Key, Auto Increment
user_id: Foreign Key referencing Users(user_id)
account_number: Unique, Not Null
account_type: Not Null
balance: Decimal(15, 2), Not Null
created_at: Default Current Timestamp
Transactions Table

## Purpose: Log all transactions made by users.
Fields:
transaction_id: Primary Key, Auto Increment
user_id: Foreign Key referencing Users(user_id)
amount: Decimal(15, 2), Not Null
transaction_date: Default Current Timestamp
transaction_type: Not Null
merchant
status
FraudAlerts Table

## Purpose: Log alerts for detected fraudulent transactions.
Fields:
alert_id: Primary Key, Auto Increment
transaction_id: Foreign Key referencing Transactions(transaction_id)
user_id: Foreign Key referencing Users(user_id)
alert_date: Default Current Timestamp
alert_type: Not Null
alert_status
TransactionLogs Table

## Purpose: Maintain logs of transactions for auditing.
Fields:
log_id: Primary Key, Auto Increment
transaction_id: Foreign Key referencing Transactions(transaction_id)
log_date: Default Current Timestamp
log_type: Not Null
log_details
Fraud Detection Rules
Large Transaction Detection

Rule: Flag transactions over a certain amount (e.g., $1000).
Purpose: Detect unusually large transactions that might indicate fraud.
Multiple Transactions in a Short Period

Rule: Flag accounts with multiple transactions within a short period (e.g., more than 3 transactions in an hour).
Purpose: Detect potential rapid transaction fraud.
Stored Procedures and Event Schedulers
Stored Procedures: Implement logic for detecting fraud based on defined rules.

## Use Case
A new user registers and their information is stored in the Users table.
A new account is created and linked to the user in the Accounts table.

Transaction Processing
When a transaction is made, it is recorded in the Transactions table.
The system checks for any suspicious activity based on predefined fraud detection rules.
Fraud Alert Generation
If a transaction matches any fraud detection rules, an alert is generated and stored in the FraudAlerts table.
Audit Logging
All transactions and alerts are logged in the TransactionLogs table for auditing purposes.

## Benefits
Improved Security: Early detection of fraudulent activities helps in minimizing financial losses.
Compliance: Maintains logs and records to comply with regulatory requirements.
Efficiency: Automated fraud detection reduces the need for manual monitoring and allows for quick responses to potential fraud.

## Future Enhancements
Machine Learning Integration: Implement advanced machine learning models to detect fraud with higher accuracy.
User Behavior Analysis: Analyze user behavior patterns to identify anomalies.
Real-Time Monitoring: Enhance the system for real-time transaction monitoring and instant alert generation.
This project establishes a comprehensive fraud detection system with a well-defined database schema and robust detection mechanisms. It provides a foundation that can be expanded with more advanced techniques and technologies to enhance fraud detection capabilities.
